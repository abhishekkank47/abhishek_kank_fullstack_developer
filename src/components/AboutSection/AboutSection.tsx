      <p className="mt-6 text-sm leading-relaxed text-primary-content md:text-lg">
        I am Abhishek Kank, a 
        Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience building scalable web 
        applications and microservices. Over the past years, I have designed and 
        developed production-ready solutions including 
        company portfolio websites, admin dashboards, e-commerce platforms, and 
        microservice-based applications using modern stacks like 
         Node.js, TypeScript, React, MongoDB, Redis, 
        Docker, and AWS S3.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-primary-content md:text-lg">
        My work spans across end-to-end system design â€” from authentication, 
        role-based access control, and API integrations to deploying containerized 
        services with Docker and Kubernetes. I have also implemented 
         CI/CD pipelines, centralized logging, 
        and scalable cloud deployments, ensuring my projects are not just 
        functional but also production-grade.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-primary-content md:text-lg">
        Beyond technical expertise, I bring a problem-solving mindset and 
        accountability. My goal is to continue building reliable, scalable 
        applications and transition into full-time trading and investing 
        after gaining strong IT experience.
