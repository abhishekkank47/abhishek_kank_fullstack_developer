        I am Abhishek Kank, a 
        Full Stack developer experienced in building complete products from the ground up from planning and development to
deployment, maintenance, and performance optimization. I’ve delivered full end-to-end systems, redesigned company
websites, built internal admin panels, handled live production data migrations without downtime, and improved overall
system stability and user experience. Comfortable working across the entire stack, I take ownership of features, understand
real business needs, and deliver solutions that scale. I’m able to work independently, manage complex requirements, and
coordinate with cross-functional teams to ship polished products on time. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code,
optimizing performance, and ensuring smooth deployment and long-term maintainability.
