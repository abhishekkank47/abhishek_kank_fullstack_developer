        I am <span className="font-semibold">Abhishek Kank</span>, a 
        Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience building scalable web 
        applications and microservices. Over the past year, I have designed and

        company portfolio websites, admin dashboards, e-commerce platforms, and 
        microservice-based applications</span> using modern stacks like

        My work spans across end-to-end system design â€” from authentication, 
        role-based access control, and API integrations to deploying containerized 
        services with Docker and Kubernetes. I have also implemented 
        <span className="font-semibold"> CI/CD pipelines, centralized logging, 
        and scalable cloud deployments</span>, ensuring my projects are not just 
        functional but also production-grade.

        Beyond technical expertise, I bring a problem-solving mindset and 
        accountability. My goal is to continue building reliable, scalable 
        applications and transition into full-time trading and investing
